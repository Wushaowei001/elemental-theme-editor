Setting up Message Channels

Extension:
  open DT, BS tells CS to listen for messages for IW, IW loads EA and PM's the MC port
Bookmarklet:
  open popup, bookmarklet code listens for MC port, popup PM's the MC port to IW

_windowUrl should probably not even require a callback because we will send the
window url once the message channel setup completes :)

1.) DT evals to check if ember app
2.) DT PM's to BS
3.) BS PM's to CS
4.) CS PM's to BS
5.) BS PM's to DT
6.) DT evals EA to IW
7.) IW sends MC port to CS
